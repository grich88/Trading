- **BONK:** Moderate position (30-50% of allocation)
- **BITCOIN (BTC):** Avoid or consider short position

### Rotation Strategy:

1. Start with SOLANA (SOL) as primary position
2. Rotate profits to BONK after first target hit
3. Consider BTC only after confirmation of trend reversal

## Model Methodology

The RSI + Volume Predictive Scoring Model integrates three key components:

1. **RSI Trend Analysis:** Evaluates RSI patterns, including streaks above/below key levels (30, 50, 70) and the relationship between raw RSI and its moving average.

2. **Volume Trend Analysis:** Assesses recent volume patterns, comparing recent volume to earlier periods and identifying volume spikes or fades in relation to price movement.

3. **Divergence Detection:** Identifies misalignments between price action and indicators, particularly when price makes new highs/lows while RSI or volume fails to confirm.

The final score is calculated as a weighted average of these components:
- 40% RSI Trend Score
- 40% Volume Trend Score
- 20% Divergence Score

Score interpretation:
- Above +0.6: Strong bullish continuation
- +0.3 to +0.6: Moderate bullish trend
- -0.3 to +0.3: Sideways/neutral
- -0.3 to -0.6: Moderate bearish trend
- Below -0.6: Strong bearish reversal warning
