# Services Module

This module contains shared services for the Trading Algorithm System.

## Purpose

The services module provides reusable services that can be used by multiple components of the system, including:

- Data collection and processing
- External API integrations
- Persistence and caching
- Notification and alerting

## Structure

- `__init__.py`: Exports the public API of the module
- `base_service.py`: Base class for all services
- Service-specific implementations (e.g., `data_service.py`, `notification_service.py`)

## Service Types

### Data Services

Services that collect, process, and store data from various sources.

### Integration Services

Services that integrate with external APIs and services.

### Utility Services

Services that provide utility functions for other components.

### Notification Services

Services that send notifications and alerts to users.

## Usage

Services should follow a consistent interface defined in the `BaseService` class:

```python
from src.services import DataService

# Initialize the service
service = DataService()

# Start the service
service.start()

# Use the service
data = service.get_data("BTC/USDT", "4h")

# Stop the service
service.stop()
```

## Dependencies

The services module may depend on:

- `utils` module
- `config` module

But it should not depend on the `models`, `core`, or `api` modules to avoid circular dependencies.
