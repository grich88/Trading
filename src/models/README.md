# Models Module

This module contains trading models and algorithms for the Trading Algorithm System.

## Purpose

The models module provides predictive models and algorithms for analyzing market data and generating trading signals, including:

- Technical indicators
- Pattern recognition
- Signal generation
- Backtesting

## Structure

- `__init__.py`: Exports the public API of the module
- `base_model.py`: Base class for all models
- Model-specific implementations (e.g., `rsi_volume_model.py`)
- `backtester.py`: Backtesting framework

## Model Types

### Market Structure Analysis

Models that analyze market structure, including support/resistance levels, trends, and patterns.

### Technical Indicators

Models based on technical indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.

### Volume Analysis

Models that analyze volume patterns and their relationship with price movements.

### Cross-Asset Correlation

Models that analyze correlations between different assets to identify leading indicators and divergences.

### Liquidation Analysis

Models that analyze liquidation data to identify potential price targets and support/resistance levels.

## Usage

Models should follow a consistent interface defined in the `BaseModel` class:

```python
from src.models import RsiVolumeModel

# Initialize the model
model = RsiVolumeModel()

# Train the model (if applicable)
model.train(data)

# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(data)
```

## Dependencies

The models module may depend on:

- `utils` module
- `config` module
- `services` module

But it should not depend on the `core` or `api` modules to avoid circular dependencies.
