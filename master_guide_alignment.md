# Master Guide Alignment

This document confirms how our implementation plan and tickets align with the Master Guide principles.

## Single Source of Truth

- **Implementation**: 
  - Centralized configuration management (Ticket 2)
  - Standardized project structure (Ticket 8)
  - Documentation framework (Ticket 10)
  - Repository structure with clear organization (Implementation Plan)

## Project & Ticket Management

- **Implementation**:
  - All tickets follow the Master Guide format with Problem Statement and Definition of Done
  - GitHub issues created for all tickets
  - Project board with columns: Loose Ideas, Backlog, ToDo, In Progress, In Review, Done
  - Each ticket has clear acceptance criteria

## Codebase & Architecture Principles

### Repository Hygiene
- **Implementation**:
  - `.gitignore` file to exclude temporary files and environment-specific files
  - CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and quality checks (Ticket 9)
  - Clean branch creation through feature branch workflow (Implementation Plan)

### Standardized Folder Structure
- **Implementation**:
  - Defined project structure in Implementation Plan
  - Directory structure follows separation of concerns
  - Module organization with clear responsibilities

### Testing Co-location
- **Implementation**:
  - Tests co-located with source code (Implementation Plan)
  - Testing framework setup (Ticket 6)

### Naming Conventions
- **Implementation**:
  - Consistent naming conventions across the codebase
  - Documentation on naming conventions (Ticket 10)

### Service Isolation
- **Implementation**:
  - Base service class with clear interfaces (Ticket 5)
  - Modular architecture with separated services

### Centralized Shared Services
- **Implementation**:
  - Shared services for common functionality (logging, configuration, error handling)
  - Base service class for consistent behavior

### Performance Optimization
- **Implementation**:
  - Memory management for long-running services (Ticket 7)
  - Performance monitoring hooks in base service class

### Memory Management
- **Implementation**:
  - Dedicated memory management implementation (Ticket 7)
  - Adaptive batch processing based on memory usage

### Isolate Debug Code
- **Implementation**:
  - Logging framework with configurable levels (Ticket 3)
  - Clean separation of debug code from production code

### API Structure Consistency
- **Implementation**:
  - Consistent API structure through base service class
  - API documentation and standards

### Separation of Formatting Concerns
- **Implementation**:
  - Clear separation between data processing and presentation
  - Modular architecture with dedicated services for each concern

### Terminology Consistency
- **Implementation**:
  - Documentation framework to ensure consistent terminology
  - Shared models and definitions

### Configuration Management
- **Implementation**:
  - Dedicated configuration management system (Ticket 2)
  - Environment-specific configurations
  - Validation of required configuration values

## Git Flow

- **Implementation**:
  - Git Flow branching model defined in Implementation Plan
  - Feature branches created from develop
  - Pull requests for code review
  - Clean branch management

## Pull Request Standards

- **Implementation**:
  - One PR, One Concern: Feature branches focused on specific functionality
  - No Merge References: Clean commit history
  - .env.example only: Configuration management through environment variables
  - No Temporary Files: .gitignore configured appropriately
  - Clean Branch Creation: Feature branches from develop
  - PR Cleanup Process: Delete feature branches after merging

## Development Process

- **Implementation**:
  - Ticket → Branch → Implement → PR → Review → Deploy workflow
  - Clear definition of done for each ticket
  - Testing requirements for all implementations

## Service Architecture and Monitoring

- **Implementation**:
  - Standardized service architecture through base service class
  - Comprehensive health monitoring built into services
  - Logging and error handling for all services
  - Memory management for long-running services

This implementation plan and ticket structure ensures that we follow all principles from the Master Guide, creating a robust, maintainable, and well-structured codebase.
