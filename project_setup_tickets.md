# Project Setup Tickets

## Ticket 1: Configure Development Environment

**Problem Statement:**
The team needs a consistent development environment to ensure code quality and minimize "works on my machine" issues. We need to establish the required Python version, dependencies, and development tools.

- Python version specified (3.9+ recommended)
- `requirements.txt` with pinned versions for all dependencies
- Development tools configured (linter, formatter)
- Documentation on setting up the development environment
- Virtual environment setup instructions

## Ticket 2: Implement Configuration Management

**Problem Statement:**
The application needs a robust configuration management system that can handle different environments (development, testing, production) and load configuration from various sources (environment variables, config files).

**Definition of Done:**
- Configuration class that loads settings from environment variables
- Support for different environments (dev, test, prod)
- Default configuration values for development
- Validation of required configuration values
- Documentation of all configuration options
- Unit tests for configuration loading and validation

## Ticket 3: Set Up Logging Framework

**Problem Statement:**
The application needs a centralized logging system to track events, errors, and performance metrics across all components.

**Definition of Done:**
- Centralized logging service
- Multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Configurable log destinations (console, file)
- Structured logging format with timestamps and context
- Log rotation for file logs
- Unit tests for logging functionality
- Documentation on how to use the logging service

## Ticket 4: Implement Error Handling Framework

**Problem Statement:**
The application needs a consistent approach to error handling to ensure that errors are properly caught, logged, and communicated to users.

**Definition of Done:**
- Custom exception hierarchy for different error types
- Error handling decorators for service methods
- Consistent error response format
- Error logging with context
- Recovery mechanisms for non-fatal errors
- Unit tests for error handling
- Documentation on how to use the error handling framework

## Ticket 5: Create Base Service Class

**Problem Statement:**
The application needs a common base class for all services to ensure consistent behavior, error handling, and resource management.

**Definition of Done:**
- Base service class with common functionality
- Lifecycle methods (init, start, stop)
- Resource management (connection pooling, cleanup)
- Error handling integration
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Memory usage monitoring
- Health check methods
- Unit tests for base service functionality
- Documentation on how to extend the base service

## Ticket 6: Set Up Testing Framework

**Problem Statement:**
The application needs a comprehensive testing framework to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

**Definition of Done:**
- Testing framework setup (pytest)
- Test directory structure
- Test fixtures for common dependencies
- Mock objects for external services
- Test coverage reporting
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation on how to write and run tests

## Ticket 7: Implement Memory Management

**Problem Statement:**
The trading system will process large amounts of data and needs to manage memory efficiently to prevent out-of-memory errors during long-running operations.

**Definition of Done:**
- Memory usage monitoring
- Configurable memory thresholds
- Adaptive batch processing based on memory usage
- Garbage collection optimization
- Memory leak detection
- Unit tests for memory management
- Documentation on memory management strategies

## Ticket 8: Create Project Structure

**Problem Statement:**
The project needs a clear and organized structure to make it easy to find and modify code.

**Definition of Done:**
- Directory structure for source code, tests, and documentation
- Module organization following separation of concerns
- Import structure that prevents circular dependencies
- README files for each major component
- Documentation on project structure and organization
- Sample files demonstrating proper code organization

## Ticket 9: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline

**Problem Statement:**
The project needs an automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and streamline deployment.

**Definition of Done:**
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Test coverage reporting
- Documentation on CI/CD process
- Deployment workflow for production releases

## Ticket 10: Create Documentation Framework

**Problem Statement:**
The project needs comprehensive documentation to help new developers understand the system and make it easier to maintain.

**Definition of Done:**
