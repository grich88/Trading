# Set Up Error Handling (Ticket #29)

## Description
This PR implements a comprehensive error handling system for the trading algorithm project, following the principles outlined in the Project Master Guide v1.0.0.

## Changes
- Enhanced `src/utils/error_handling.py` with:
  - Additional exception classes for specific error types
  - Async retry decorator for async functions
  - Error context managers (sync and async)
  - Safe execution utilities for functions and async functions
  - Improved retry mechanism with jitter
- Created `src/utils/error_handling_test.py` with comprehensive tests for all features
- Updated `src/utils/__init__.py` to export all error handling features

## Features
- Standardized exception hierarchy for consistent error handling
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and jitter
- Context managers for cleaner error handling
- Safe execution utilities for functions and async functions
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous code

## Testing
- Added unit tests for all exception classes
- Added unit tests for retry decorators
- Added unit tests for context managers
- Added unit tests for safe execution utilities
- Added integration tests for combined features
- All tests are passing

## Compliance with Master Guide
This implementation adheres to the following principles from the Master Guide:
- Centralized error handling
- Consistent error reporting
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear separation of concerns
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous code

## Related Issues
Closes #29
