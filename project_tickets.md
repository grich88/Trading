# Trading Algorithm System - Project Tickets

This document outlines all tickets for implementing the Trading Algorithm System, organized by epics and following the Master Guide principles.

## Master Guide Principles

All tickets adhere to the following principles from our Master Guide v1.0.0:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each component has one clear purpose and responsibility
2. **Service Isolation**: Services are self-contained with clear interfaces
3. **Centralized Shared Services**: Common functionality is unified in shared services
4. **No Premature Optimization**: Focus on correctness first, optimize when needed
5. **Memory Management**: Adaptive batch processing for large datasets
6. **Isolated Debug Code**: Debug routes and logic separate from main API
7. **API Structure Consistency**: All endpoints follow established patterns
8. **Separation of Formatting Concerns**: Core services return standardized data structures
9. **Terminology Consistency**: Clear, consistent terms throughout the codebase
10. **Configuration Management**: No hardcoded values, use environment variables
