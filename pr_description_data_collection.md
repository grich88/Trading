# Set Up Data Collection Services (Ticket #31)

## Description
This PR implements a comprehensive data collection service for the trading algorithm project, following the principles outlined in the Project Master Guide v1.0.0. The service builds on the existing data service and provides advanced features for collecting market data from various sources.

## Changes
- Created `src/services/data_collection.py` with:
  - `DataCollectionService` class that extends `LongRunningService`
  - Scheduled data collection functionality
  - Real-time data streaming capabilities
  - Multi-exchange support
  - Rate limiting and concurrency control
  - Async data fetching for improved performance
  - Data validation and normalization
- Created `src/services/data_collection_test.py` with comprehensive tests
- Updated `src/services/__init__.py` to export the new service

## Features
- Scheduled data collection with configurable intervals
- Real-time data streaming from exchanges
- Concurrent data fetching with rate limiting
- Support for multiple exchanges and data sources
- Integration with existing data service for storage and processing
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Memory-efficient batch processing
- Performance monitoring and statistics
- Extensive test coverage

## Testing
- Added unit tests for all major functionality
- Added async tests for asynchronous methods
- Mocked external dependencies for reliable testing
- Tests cover both success and error scenarios

## Compliance with Master Guide
This implementation adheres to the following principles from the Master Guide:
- Service-oriented architecture
- Centralized data collection
- Asynchronous processing for improved performance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Memory management for large datasets
- Extensive test coverage
- Integration with existing services
