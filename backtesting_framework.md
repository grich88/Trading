# Backtesting Framework for RSI + Volume Predictive Model

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive backtesting framework for the Enhanced RSI + Volume Predictive Scoring Model. The framework is designed to evaluate the model's performance over historical data, identify areas for improvement, and optimize the model parameters.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Historical Data Collection (`historical_data_collector.py`)

This component is responsible for fetching historical OHLCV data and calculating all necessary indicators:

- Fetches 2 years of historical 4-hour data for BTC, SOL, and other assets
- Calculates RSI, RSI SMA, EMAs for WebTrend, and other technical indicators
- Simulates liquidation data based on price action and volume patterns
- Saves processed data for use in backtesting

### 2. Model Backtesting (`model_backtest.py`)

This component implements the walk-forward testing methodology:

- Starts with a minimum window of data (e.g., first 50 candles)
- For each 4-hour candle:
  - Applies the model to current data (blinded to future)
  - Generates predictions and signals
  - Records predictions
  - Moves forward one candle
  - Compares previous predictions to actual outcomes

### 3. Performance Analysis (`performance_analyzer.py`)

This component evaluates the model's performance:

- Calculates win rate (% of correct signals)
- Measures profit/loss for each trade
- Calculates risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)
- Measures maximum drawdown
- Analyzes performance by market condition

### 4. Model Optimization (`model_optimizer.py`)

This component identifies improvements to the model:

- Optimizes component weights
- Fine-tunes signal thresholds
- Adjusts entry/exit rules
- Customizes parameters for different market conditions

## Backtesting Methodology

### Walk-Forward Testing

The backtesting uses a walk-forward approach to avoid look-ahead bias:

1. Start with initial training window (e.g., 50 candles)
2. Generate prediction for next candle
3. Move forward one candle
4. Evaluate previous prediction
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the end of the dataset

### Signal Evaluation

For each prediction, we evaluate:

- Direction accuracy (up/down)
- Price target accuracy (TP1, TP2)
- Stop-loss effectiveness
- Time to reach targets

### Trade Simulation

We simulate trades based on the model's signals:

- Entry at the close of the signal candle
- Exit at either:
  - Take profit level
  - Stop loss level
  - Signal reversal

## Performance Metrics

### 1. Accuracy Metrics

- Win rate: % of profitable trades
- Direction accuracy: % of correctly predicted price directions
- Target accuracy: % of price targets reached

### 2. Risk-Adjusted Return Metrics

- Sharpe ratio: Return per unit of risk
- Sortino ratio: Return per unit of downside risk
- Maximum drawdown: Largest peak-to-trough decline

### 3. Comparative Metrics

- Performance vs. buy-and-hold strategy
- Performance across different market conditions
- Performance across different assets

## Model Optimization

### 1. Component Weight Optimization

We optimize the weights of each model component:

- RSI trend score weight
- Volume trend score weight
- Divergence score weight
- Liquidation score weight
- WebTrend score weight

### 2. Signal Threshold Optimization

We optimize the thresholds for generating signals:

- Strong buy threshold
- Buy threshold
- Neutral range
- Sell threshold
- Strong sell threshold

### 3. Asset-Specific Adjustments

We customize the model for each asset:

- Volatility coefficients
- RSI thresholds
- Volume sensitivity

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch and process historical data
2. **Initial Backtesting**: Run the model with default parameters
3. **Performance Analysis**: Identify strengths and weaknesses
4. **Parameter Optimization**: Find optimal parameters
5. **Validation**: Test optimized model on out-of-sample data
6. **Final Evaluation**: Generate comprehensive performance report

## Expected Outcomes

The backtesting framework will provide:

1. Comprehensive performance metrics for the model
2. Optimized parameters for each asset and market condition
3. Insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses
4. Recommendations for model improvements
5. A robust framework for ongoing model evaluation and refinement
