## Trading Strategy Recommendations

### Recommended Allocation Based on Model Scores:

- **BONK:** Strong position (60-80% of allocation)
- **BTC:** Moderate position (30-50% of allocation)
- **SOL:** Avoid or consider short position

### Rotation Strategy:

1. Start with BONK as primary position
2. Consider BTC only after confirmation of trend strength
3. Avoid SOL until signals improve

## Model Enhancements

The Enhanced RSI + Volume Predictive Scoring Model now incorporates:

1. **Liquidation Heatmap Analysis**: Identifies support and resistance levels based on liquidation clusters from Coinglass data.

2. **WebTrend Confirmation**: Uses WebTrend indicator status to confirm trend direction.

3. **Asset-Specific Volatility Adjustments**: Applies different volatility coefficients based on asset characteristics (BONK: 1.2, SOL: 1.0, BTC: 0.8).

4. **Dynamic Target Price Calculation**: Adjusts take profit and stop loss levels based on ATR (Average True Range) and liquidation clusters.

5. **Inter-Asset Correlation**: Considers the typical flow of momentum from one asset to another (BTC → SOL → BONK).

## Key Observations

1. **SOL vs BTC Divergence**: SOL and BTC are showing opposite signals, with SOL bearish and BTC neutral-bullish. This divergence suggests caution and potential rotation between assets.

2. **BONK Leading**: BONK is showing the strongest bullish signal despite its higher volatility, suggesting a potential early-stage move that could lead to significant gains.

3. **Liquidation Impact**: Liquidation clusters are having a significant impact on the model's predictions, particularly for SOL where strong resistance is detected overhead.

4. **Volume Patterns**: Volume analysis is providing strong signals across all assets, with SOL showing distribution patterns while BTC and BONK show accumulation.

## Conclusion

Based on the Enhanced RSI + Volume Predictive Scoring Model, the current market presents a mixed picture with BONK offering the best opportunity for long positions. The model suggests a rotation strategy starting with BONK, followed by BTC if signals improve, while avoiding or shorting SOL until its signals turn positive.

The incorporation of liquidation heatmap data and WebTrend confirmation has significantly improved the model's predictive capabilities, providing more nuanced and actionable trading signals.
